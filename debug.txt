Remember to plan your work out

1. Check the syntax (GPT should catch this)
2. Walk through your logic

2.5. If it's an algorithm:
Are you considering all possible data structures?
Could you have multiple options for different cases?
Did you whiteboard it?

3. Reference other code of yours

3.5. Before you google it:
-Should I know this code?
-Should I be able to do this?
-Did I thoroughly complete steps 1-3?

4. Google it
5. Ask GPT
