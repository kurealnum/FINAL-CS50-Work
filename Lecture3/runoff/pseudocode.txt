Tabulate explanation: my dumb ass is def gonna forget how this works later on soooo;
loop through voters, and while you're going through each voter, "ask them" (loop through)
what their choice of candidate is. then check if the candidate is still in the election.
if they are, add the voters vote to their variable.
